# Overweight/Obese Populations By Location

This visualization examines the prevalence of overweight and obese populations by location and by gender.

## Prevalence Split By Sex
This line graph displays the percentage of people who are overweight and obese for the selected location. The red line represents females, the blue line represents males, and the green line represents both sexes. All three lines are drawn at the same time in order for comparisons to be made between the three.

## Log Base 2 Ratio of Males to Females
This bar graph displays the log ratio between males to females. The log ratio is used to visualize the magnitude of difference easier as opposed to relative ratio. If a country has a log base 2 ratio that is 2, in the context of this graph this means that there are 4 times as many males who are overweight/obese than there are females.
